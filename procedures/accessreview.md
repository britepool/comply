Subject: Access Review

Please indicate any access changes that should be made by contacting the director of each team and having them either verify there are no changes needed or they indicate changes are NEEDED in their employees' access to systems based on their duties.

Remember that "In order to minimize the risk of information loss or exposure (from both inside and outside the organization), the organization is reliant on the principle of least privilege. Account creation and permission levels are restricted to only the resources absolutely needed to perform each person’s job duties. When a user’s role within the organization changes, those accounts and permission levels are changed/revoked to fit the new role or duties."
